          <p class="text-slate-600">
            By booking a tour with Komani Lake Tours (Mario Molla), you agree to our terms. All bookings are subject to availability. A booking is considered confirmed once you receive a confirmation email or voucher from us. Standard prices include the services explicitly mentioned in the tour description.

          <p class="text-slate-600">
            Currently, we primarily accept cash payments (Euro or Albanian LEK) upon arrival or at the start of the tour. For large groups or private charters, a deposit may be requested in advance. All prices are final as listed, with no hidden booking fees.

          <p class="text-slate-600">
            We understand that plans change. You can cancel your booking free of charge up to 48 hours before the tour start time. Cancellations made less than 48 hours in advance or "no-shows" may not be eligible for a refund of any prepaid deposits.

          <p class="text-slate-600">
            The safety of our guests is our absolute priority. Komani Lake and the Shala River are alpine environments where weather can change rapidly. We reserve the right to modify itineraries or cancel tours due to extreme weather, safety concerns, or government restrictions. In the event of a cancellation by us, a full refund or alternative date will be offered.

          <p class="text-slate-600">
            While we maintain high safety standards and fully insured vessels, participation in outdoor activities (including hiking, kayaking, and boat travel) involves inherent risks. Komani Lake Tours and its partners are not liable for personal injury, loss, or damage to personal property unless caused by our direct negligence.
